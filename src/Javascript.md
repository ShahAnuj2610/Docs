The Appbase JS library allows developers to create realtime multi-user apps using a graph data model and realtime smart-search capabilities.

The Appbase library exposes the ``Appbase`` object. The methods in the JS lib rely on three main objects.

1. **Appbase**
2. **Namespace Reference** (referred as ``nsref`` in this doc)
3. **Vertex Reference** (referred as ``vref`` in this doc)
