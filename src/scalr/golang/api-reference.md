[go-appbase](https://github.com/appbaseio/go-appbase) is a data streams library for Go.

It can:

* Continuously stream updates to documents, queries or filters over http-streams.  
* Index new documents and update existing ones.  
* Is compatible with [Elasticsearch's Go Client](https://github.com/olivere/elastic) maintained by Olivere. 

You can read the [quick start guide](http://docs.appbase.io/scalr/golang/golang-intro.html) for installation and basic usage.
